It looks like a total of 4 vessels along with some downstream equipment.  I would be interested in bidding on two or all of the fermenters if they met our needs.    I don’t see an agitation system installed but it is quite possible that it’s a magnetic drive based on my initial review of the pics.   I don’t see baffles installed as well but that could be something also removed OR something we could install later.  We really don’t have a need for the downstream filtration skid and associated equipment. Do you have any further details on this?  Is this something we could part out in reference to what I am interested in?  \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\ndave\r\n\r\nDavid Ball\r\nProcess Development\r\nSolarvest (P.E.I.)
